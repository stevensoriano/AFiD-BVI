# AFID-BVI
A highly parallel application for Blade-Vortex Interactions (BVI).

AFiD-BVI is a code for parallel numerical simulations of Blade-Vortex Interactions (BVI) built from [AFiD](https://github.com/PhysicsofFluids/AFiD). The code will solve the fluid flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid coupled with fluid-structure interactions.

The code uses energy-conserving centered finite differences to discretize the domain spatially. Time marching is done third-order Runge-Kutta for the non-linear terms and second-order Crank-Nicolson for the viscous terms. Using a moving least squares formulation, the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is used to incorporate the body into the flow field.

The computational domain is a triply periodic box that allows a body of any geometry to be incorporated into the flow field. The body is represented in a GTS (GNU Triangulated Surface) file format. The body can be programmed to move within the flow field. The Vortex is initialized using a Lambâ€“Oseen vortex distribution and can be oriented to solve normal, parallel, and oblique BVI.

## Features

Some features are:
- Provision for handling multiple deformable bodies, which are represented using an Immersed Boundary approach
- An interaction-potential approach allows for the deformation of the immersed bodies
- Moving Least Squares (MLS) is used for the information exchange
- Parallelised using MPI pencils
