# IBM-IP-NS Solver
## Part 3 - Homogenous isotropic flow

### Immersed Boundary Method - Interaction Potential - Navier Stokes Solver
### Second-order finite-difference solver for Homogenous Isotropic Turbulent carrier Flow

- Provision for handling multiple deformable bodies which are represented using a Immersed Boundary approach.
- An interaction-potential approach allows for deformation of the immersed bodies. 
- Moving Least Squares (MLS) is used for the information exchange.
- Parallelised using MPI slabs
- Different parallelisation strategies for flow and structural solver.
- Inertial point particles included
